    <p>My mom is the most beautifully unique person I know. She truly embodies the saying: "Always Be Yourself". From her fashion sense, to the way she laughs, she's sure to put a smile on your face. She's given me all the best parts of herself: an endless wanderlust, love of plants and animals, and the courage to try new things. Unlike me though, she'll talk your ear off. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Her ability to make anyone she meets feel special and loved is truly admirable.
